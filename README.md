# FinTechs Capstone Project: Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction

### Description
* The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businesses–only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.

* In this competition, we’re challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.
* 
### Objective: 
* Customer targeting is one of the most successful techniques to induce recurring revenue. The developed machine learning methods predict customer spending and allow for a more concise use of marketing budgets, resulting in higher revenue and profitability for companies.
